# The LIBEREADER

15 Project 2: Interactive Full-Stack Application
Projects play a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you enter the last phase of the boot camp, you’ll begin to apply for development jobs. If you want to land interviews, your portfolio must feature high-quality deployed examples of your work—-and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.
As your first opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, this particular project will be a focal point of your portfolio. Employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job.

Project Requirements
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:


Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.


Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.


Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database. The database must be initialized with a schema and seeded with some data.


Must have at least 2 tables in the Mysql database with clearly defined column types. The two tables must have at least ONE type of relationship (one to one, one to many...etc)


Have at least 1 GET, 1 POST, and 1 DELETE route for retrieving data, adding data, and deleting data from the database. For the DELETE Route, you may choose to delete ALL the data in the database besides the seeded data, or delete ONE row by ID.


Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.


Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.


Include authentication (express-session and cookies). At least ONE of your routes must be protected by authentication.


Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables. Secrets should not be in the Git history.


Be deployed using Heroku (with data). The backend must also be deployed on Heroku (Mysql).


Have a polished UI. You should have at LEAST one page "View" that the users can interact with and trigger all 3 required routes using interactive html elements.


Front end View pages must be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input). At least a portion of a page should have user login.


Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).


Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).



Presentation Requirements
Use this project presentation template to address the following: Each presentation should be about 10 minutes in total.


Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application


Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?


Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?


Demo: Show your stuff!


Directions for Future Development


Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository. Use the Guide to Deploy with Heroku and MySQL on The Full-Stack Blog if you need a reminder on how to deploy to Heroku.



Grading Requirements

Note: If a project submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:


A repository that is detected to be plagiarised (copying previous assignments exactly or copying things online)


A project in which you did not contribute towards (very few commits)


Not coming to the presentation/not presenting with your group.



This project is graded based on the following criteria:

Technical Acceptance Criteria: 65%


Satisfies the following code requirements:


Application uses a Node.js and Express.js back end and uses at least 1 GET, 1 POST, and 1 DELETE route for retrieving, adding, and deleting new data. (15%)


Application has a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm and uses Handlebars.js as the template engine. (5%)


Application is backed by a MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM and has a defined schema and seeded data. (10%)


Application protects API keys and sensitive information with environment variables. (5%)


Application includes user authentication (express-session and cookies). (5% for backend, 5% for frontend)


Application has at least one front end page that can call all 3 backend pages. (15%)


Application uses at least one new library, package, or technology not covered in class. (5%)





Concept 5%


Application should be a unique and novel idea. (2%)


Your group should clearly and concisely articulate your project idea. (3%)



Deployment: 5%


Application deployed at live URL on Heroku and loads with no errors. (No errors: full points 5%, Mysql not working: 3%, nothing working on heroku: 0% credit)


Application GitHub URL submitted AND live Heroku URL submitted. If not submitted, you get a 0. (0%)



Repository Quality: 5%


Repository has a unique name. (1%)


Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions. (1%)


Repository follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc. (1%)


Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages. (1%)


Repository contains quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application. (1%)



Application Quality: 10%


Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate. Application user interface style is clean and polished. Application is usable and has no errors. (3%)


At least one page is accessible to not logged in users, and some content (at least one route) is only accessible to logged in users. (7%)



Presentation 10%


The powerpoint should describe which "new technology" you included on your website. (5%)


Your presentation should follow the Project Presentation Template. (5%)



Collaboration (Does not affect grade but can lower your personal grade if issues arise.)


Every group member should speak during the presentation.


There are no major disparities in the number of GitHub contributions between group members.



How to Submit Your Interactive Full-Stack Project
Each member of your group is required to submit the following for review:


The URL of the deployed application.


The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project.
