# The LIBEREADER

15 Project 2: Interactive Full-Stack Application
Projects play a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you enter the last phase of the boot camp, you’ll begin to apply for development jobs. If you want to land interviews, your portfolio must feature high-quality deployed examples of your work—-and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.
As your first opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, this particular project will be a focal point of your portfolio. Employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job.

Project Requirements
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:


* Use Node.js
* Express.js to create a RESTful API.


* Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.


* Use MySQL 
* Sequelize ORM for the database. 
* The database must be initialized with a schema and seeded with some data.


* Must have at least 2 tables in the Mysql database with clearly defined column types. 

The two tables must have at least ONE type of relationship 

* one to one, 
* one to many...etc


Have at least 
* 1 GET retrieving data
* 1 POST adding data
* 1 DELETE route for deleting data from the database


For the DELETE Route, you may choose to 
* delete ALL the data in the database besides the seeded data, 
* or delete ONE row by ID.


* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.


* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.


* Include authentication (express-session and cookies)
At least ONE of your routes must be protected by authentication.


* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables. 
Secrets should not be in the Git history.


* Be deployed using Heroku (with data). 
* The backend must also be deployed on Heroku (Mysql).


* Have a polished UI. 
* You should have at LEAST one page "View" that the users can interact with and trigger all 3 required routes using interactive html elements.


* Front end View pages must be interactive 
(i.e., accept and respond to user input). At least a portion of a page should have user login.


* Meet good-quality coding standards 
(file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).


* Have a professional README 
(with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).



* Presentation Requirements
Use this project presentation template to address the following: Each presentation should be about 10 minutes in total.


* Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application


* Concept: What is your user story? 
* What was your motivation for development?


* Process: What were the technologies used? 
* How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? 
* What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?


* Demo: Show your stuff!


* Directions for Future Development


* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository.
* Use the Guide to Deploy with Heroku and MySQL on The Full-Stack Blog if you need a reminder on how to deploy to Heroku.
