## Result
We developed a well-crafted, functioning, user friendly, intuitive website for searching books and providing personal review for the books that you have read. 

We incorporated server side google books Api that helps to draw data for any books in the library by genre, author and title.

Every registered account and user can browse books from the library and write their own review of the book which can be stored in their personal account.
